# Godot Stealth Game

Why is the Repo called "GodotFirstPersonController"? Well, I originally wanted to just write a simple FirstPersonController for Godot to learn Godot but when I noticed how easy that was, I decided to continue the project into some kind of FirstPerson shooter/stealth game.
The game still only features one level but I learned a lot about Godot while creating the games mechanics.

## Goal

In the building, there's a red briefcase you need to find and extract. The way you want to achieve this is your decision.

## Implemented systems

The game features enemy vision (seeing the player) and a sound system that allows enemies to investigate noises like thrown coins, footsteps, gunshots and other enemies yelling.
